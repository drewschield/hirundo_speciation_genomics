# Sexual selection promotes reproductive isolation in barn swallows: Genomic analysis workflow

![Sexual selection promotes reproductive isolation in barn swallows](/cover-image.png "cover image")

This repository contains details on the data processing and analysis steps used to study the role of sexual selection in speciation through 1) the characterization of the genetic architecture of sexual signal traits in barn swallows (_Hirundo rustica_), 2) tests of divergent sexual selection in geographic isolation, 3) tests of selection against gene flow at trait loci in secondary contact, and 4) tests that selection has maintained associations between trait loci, known as genetic coupling, which lead to reproductive isolation due to sexual selection. This workflow is a companion to the methods described in Schield et al. (_in review_).
