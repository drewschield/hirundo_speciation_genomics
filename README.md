# Sexual selection promotes reproductive isolation in barn swallows: Genomic analysis workflow

![Sexual selection promotes reproductive isolation in barn swallows](/cover-image.png "cover image")

This repository contains details on the data processing and analysis steps used to study the role of sexual selection in speciation through 1) the characterization of the genetic architecture of sexual signal traits in barn swallows (_Hirundo rustica_), 2) tests of divergent sexual selection in geographic isolation, 3) tests of selection against gene flow at trait loci in secondary contact, and 4) tests that selection has maintained associations between trait loci, known as genetic coupling, leading to reproductive isolation due to sexual selection. This workflow is a companion to the methods described in Schield et al. (_in review_).

Lists and reference files can be found in various analysis directories, as can Shell and Python scripts used in elements of the analysis workflow. R scripts are in the `R` directory. Note that you may need to adjust the organization of path/file locations to suit your environment. This workflow assumes that you return to the main working directory after completing major analysis sections.
